# Thesis - Performance comparition between Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL Database
Here you can find the source code for the master's thesis entitled "Performance comparison between Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API) and Azure SQL Database using Python libraries".

In this study, the performance of Azure Cosmos DB, a non-relational database, is compared with that of Azure SQL Database, a relational database, using CRUD operations. The response times of the databases for the specific use cases of the CRUD operations INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE are measured and analyzed in order to draw conclusions about the performance of the two database types.
